  * A Krutrim Cloud account and API key.

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shashwat-Akhilesh-Shukla/Linkedin_Chat_System

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your API keys:

```

API_KEY="YOUR_KRUTRIM_CLOUD_API_KEY"
```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
streamlit
openai
langchain

```

### 4\. Run the Application

Once dependencies are installed and environment variables are set, run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open the application in your web browser.

## How to Use

1.  **Enter LinkedIn Profile URL**: In the Streamlit app, paste the URL of the LinkedIn profile you want to analyze.
2.  **Enter Target Job Role**: Provide the job role you are aiming for (e.g., "Senior Software Engineer," "Data Scientist").
3.  **Analyze Profile**: Click the "Analyze Profile" button. The application will scrape the profile data.
4.  **Start Chatting**: Once the profile is scraped, you can ask questions or give commands in the chat input, such as:
      * "Analyze my profile."
      * "How well does my profile match a Data Scientist role?"
      * "Rewrite my experience section to better suit a Product Manager role."

The AI agent will then process your request and provide a relevant response based on the scraped profile data and the target job role.
